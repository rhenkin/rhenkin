### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher and Data Engineer at Queen Mary University of London. I'm an expert in interactive data visualisation and EHR datasets such as CPRD. I work with Python, R or Javascript depending on the situation (e.g. project requirements or collaborators' expertise). I created the following packages:

- (R) [shinyExprPortal: a configurable portal for sharing analysis of molecular expression data](http://github.com/C4TB/shinyExprPortal)
- (R) [visxhclust: an app for visual exploration of hierarchical clustering](http://github.com/rhenkin/visxhclust)
- (R) [Interactive legends - Shiny UI component](http://github.com/rhenkin/vfinputs)

I'm a researcher in the [AI MULTIPLY](https://ai-multiply.co.uk/) consortium where I have been working on CPRD GOLD and CPRD Aurum datasets. As part of that, I authored or co-authored the following pipelines and packages:

- (Python) [bursty_dynamics](https://github.com/ai-multiply/bursty_dynamics): a Python package to perform burstiness analysis on event data, including functions to calculate scores, compute trains and visualise results
- (Python + shell scripts) [CPRD Data Pipeline Generator](https://github.com/ai-multiply/CPRD-DataPipelineGenerator): an HPC job generator to process raw CPRD data and prepare an SQLite database for analysis-ready data, including codelist annotations and other steps.
