### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher and Data Engineer at the [Centre for Translational Bioinformatics](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/c4tb/) at Queen Mary University of London. My background is in data visualisation and I'm interested in making visualisations more useful in data analysis workflows, beyond communication for publishing results. I developed two R Shiny packages as an example of that: [visxhclust: an app for visual exploration of hierarchical clustering](http://github.com/rhenkin/visxhclust) and [shinyExprPortal: a configurable portal for sharing analysis of molecular expression data](http://github.com/C4TB/shinyExprPortal). I also created a [Shiny UI component](http://github.com/rhenkin/vfinputs) which enables filtering data through interactive colour legends. I use R, Python or JavaScript depending on the project I'm working on and what is easier for collaborators.
