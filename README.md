### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher and Data Engineer with the [Centre for Translational Bioinformatics](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/c4tb/) at Queen Mary University of London. My background is in data visualisation and I'm interested in a tightening the gap between visualisations and data analysis workflows where visualisation is typically an afterthought for communicating results. I have developed a Shiny app for [visual exploration of hierarchical clustering](http://github.com/rhenkin/visxhclust) and a [Shiny UI component](http://github.com/rhenkin/vfinputs) for filtering with interactive colour legends. I use R, Python or JavaScript (D3) depending on the project and collaborators' needs.
