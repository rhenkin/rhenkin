### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher and Data Engineer at Queen Mary University of London. My background is in data visualisation and I'm interested in making visualisations more useful throughout complete data analysis workflows and not only for communication. I work with Python, R or Javascript depending on what project I'm working on and which language makes it easier to collaborate with other people. I created the following packages:

- (R) [shinyExprPortal: a configurable portal for sharing analysis of molecular expression data](http://github.com/C4TB/shinyExprPortal)
- (R) [visxhclust: an app for visual exploration of hierarchical clustering](http://github.com/rhenkin/visxhclust)
- (R) [Interactive legends - Shiny UI component](http://github.com/rhenkin/vfinputs)
